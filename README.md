# Rider Trip Cost Forecasting Project
## Project Overview
For Course 1, a PACE Strategy Document was created to serve as a plan for the project. The strategy document considered the audience, teammates, key milestones, and the overall goal to be achieved.

Once the strategy document was completed, a Project Proposal was prepared for presentation to the data team.

The overall objective of the project is to create a precise forecast model for predicting the cost of a rider's trip using regression and machine learning techniques. This model aims to provide riders with a fare estimate before they embark on their journey.

## Data Understanding
The project focuses on trip-related data, including features relevant for predicting rider costs. The data will be used to train and validate a regression or machine learning model capable of providing accurate fare estimates.

## Modeling and Evaluation
The modeling goal is to develop a regression or machine learning-based forecast model that predicts trip costs accurately. Evaluation will focus on assessing model performance in terms of prediction precision and reliability.

## Conclusion
The strategy and proposal set the foundation for building a model that delivers actionable fare predictions to riders. This approach ensures the project is well-planned, aligned with key milestones, and directed toward achieving its overall goal.
