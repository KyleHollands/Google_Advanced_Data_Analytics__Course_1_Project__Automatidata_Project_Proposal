For Course 1, a PACE Strategy Document was created to serve as a plan for the project. The strategy document considered the audience, teammates, key milestones, and overall goal to be achieved. Once the strategy document was completed, a Project Proposal was prepared for presentation to the data team.

Overall Project Overview: The objective of this project is to create a precise forecast model for predicting the cost of a rider's trip through regression and machine learning techniques. This will provide riders with a fare estimate before they embark on their journey.
